# Blurb grader

A story blurb, aka synopsis or story description, helps readers decide if they want to read a story.

Consequently, it is helpful for book authors and publishers to know how the text in a blurb compares to other books that target a specific demographic, such as children in a certain school grade range. Given a short blurb about a book, this app will classify the storyline's target school grade range. This app helps writers validate if they are indeed writing to the book's target school grade range given a text blurb about a book and to understand how their choice of words influenced the classification.
