"40606","Migrant Mother: How a Photograph Defined the Great Depression ","Dorothea Lange’s photographs gave Americans a clear view of the hardships suffered during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. The famous image for which she was known was taken at a migrant-worker camp in Nipomo, California, and would eventually be seen as the very symbol of the Depression. Even though Lange wanted to use the photo to effect political change, she had no idea how her portrait of a tired-looking woman and her children would affect history. The photograph, one of many that helped show the human misery characterized by the Depression, shocked the U.S. government into providing relief for millions of American families.
